# Complexity Economics

In this repository, I include several projects for the Complexity Economics class.

## Overview

The repository includes:

- **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming:**
  - Demonstrates basic principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
  - Includes examples such as class creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

- **Solow Model Simulation:**
  - Simulates the Solow Growth Model, illustrating the long-term dynamics of capital accumulation, technological progress, and population growth.
  - Users can adjust parameters like savings rate, depreciation, and population growth to analyze steady-state outcomes.

- **Ultimatum Game:**
  - Implements an agent-based simulation of the Ultimatum Game, highlighting behavioral economics principles.
  - Explores how fairness and negotiation strategies evolve over multiple iterations of the game.

- **Logistic Map Foundation:**
  - Explores the logistic map as a foundational model in chaos theory.
  - Includes visualizations of bifurcation diagrams.
